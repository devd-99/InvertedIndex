# InvertedIndex
Basic inverted index made for an Information Retrieval assignment. Currently hardcoded for specific set of files, but will be made dynamic.

Python3 used.

Run the Sorter.py to store/update your dict.json file, and then Query.py to run basic queries, to search from the inverted index created.
