According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, "since 1979, winter Arctic ice extent has decreased about 4.2 percent per decade". Both 2008 and 2009 had a minimum Arctic sea ice extent somewhat above that of 2007. At other times of the year the ice extent is still sometimes near the 1979â€“2000 average, as in April 2010, by the data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.[3] Still, between these same years, the overall average ice coverage appears to have declined from 8 million km2 to 5 million km2
