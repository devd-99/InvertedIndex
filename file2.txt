Icebergs are possible on Earth because our oceans are filled with water as opposed to some other liquid. Unlike most substances, water is less dense in its solid state than its liquid state. Planets with oceans consisting of other types of liquids, such as methane, cannot have icebergs, precisely because the frozen substance would sink.
